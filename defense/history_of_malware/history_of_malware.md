# task 1 - Introduction
Room is dedicated to first types of **malware**. 
"Malware" consists of two words combined; *malicious* and *software*. Typically, Malware is designed to cause damage to Computers or Networks, this may be on a very large scale or only on a local network (LAN).

# task 2 - The Creeper Program

Malicious Software has been around since **1949**.
First know theories was created by **John von Neumann**
John devised the *von Neumann architecture* (which is very simply how computers transfer **data** to its hardware), produced work detailing **self-replicating** computer programs.

The Creeper Program, also known as the "Creeper worm" or "virus", was the first-ever virus to be created. Written by **Bob Thomas** in 1971, the program used **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) to transfer itself between computers (keep reading to learn about ARPANET).
Programmed in PDP-10 Assemby, which ran on OS TENEX
Displayed "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"
**Ray Tomlision** redesigned the Creeper Virus to copy to each computer.

## ARPANET

ARPANET originally started out with two specific protocols; Remote login and transferring files. After their project was denied, the team working on this project (known as the **Network Working Group**) decided to design a program formally called the *Network Control Program*, without all the unnecessary details, this was the start of computers being able to communicate within networks. 

**Packet Switching** is breaking data into packets to then route or send said data to the receiver. The receiver (computer that is receiving the data) will then reassemble the packets back into whatever data/file was being sent. (this is still used today!)

This was the main way that data was transferred using ARPANET.

# task 2 - questions and answers

1. Who re-designed the Creeper Virus?

Ray Tomlinson

2. How is data transferred through a network?

Packet Switching

3. Who created the first concept of a virus?

John Von Neumann

4. What text did the Creeper program print to the screen?

"I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"

5. What does ARPANET stand for>

Advanced Research Projects Agency Network

6. Which team created the network control program?

Network Working Group

7. What is the first virus commonly known as?

Creeper

# Task 3 - Reaper

Reaper's purpose was to remove any copies of creeper that it could find, but it moved differently to Creeper
Bob Thomas' main project was "to develop a resource-sharing capability", known as RSEXEC "so that users could develop applications that could move to and run on another computer".
Reaper would move its way similarly to Creeper and then get to work; removing Creeper.
Reaper was actually first **anti-virus**

## task 3 - questions and answers

1. Who created Reaper?

Ray Tomlinson

2. What type of malware may Reaper be known as?

nematode

3. What was the first anti-virus program known as?

Reaper

4. What was Bob Thomas's main project to develop?

a resource-sharing capability

5. What does API stand for?

Application PRogramming Interface

# task 4 - Wabbit

**The Wabbit**(Rabbit) virus was written in **1974**.
One of first *self-replicating* malware.
Wabbit would work so fast that the system would figuratively choke on its resources and end up crashing. 
Considered first malicious program and grew from concepts of malware created from *other computer scientists*
Malware only infected hosts machine.
Rabbit as being a form of DoS known as "fork bomb"

**Rabbit works by** creating an infinite loop that continually creates system processes and copies of the original file, creating a high number of CPU cycles (the time for the execution of one process) which "constipates" the system and consumes operating system resources, causing it to get slower until its eventual crash. 

# task 4 - questions and answers

1. What is a modern day fork bomb also known as?

denial of service attack

2. Was Rabbit one of the first malicious programs

3. What did the name "Wabbit" derive from?

looney tunes cartoons

# task 5 - ANIMAL

In **1975** first *trojan* was written
**ANIMAL**, created by **John Walker**, would act as a game and ask the user a number of questions to guess the type of animal they were thinking of. Whilst the user played the "fun" game, another program, or subroutine, called "PERVADE" would create a copy of itself and *ANIMAL* in every directory that the user has access to. 

*ANIMAL* was **NOT** malicious however, the program was carefully written to ensure that no directory structure or files were damaged. It spread across UNIVACs (Universal Automatic Computer) when users with overlapping permissions discovered the game. Eventually, the program was halted by an unintended Operating System upgrade, which changed the format of the file status tables that PERVADE used for safe copying (file status tables allowed the program to avoid copying to the wrong area, causing damage) this meant that ANIMAL could not find any place safe to copy and stopped itself.

# task 5 - questions and answers

1. When was PERVADE added to ANIMAL?

1975

2. Did John think this was a good idea?

Y

3. What computers did the program spread across?

UNIVACs

4. What type of malware is ANIMAL also known as?

a trojan

5. Who built the wooden horse?

the Greeks

# task 6 - Elk Cloner
