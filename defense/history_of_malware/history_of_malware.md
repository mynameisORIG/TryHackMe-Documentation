# task 1 - Introduction
Room is dedicated to first types of **malware**. 
"Malware" consists of two words combined; *malicious* and *software*. Typically, Malware is designed to cause damage to Computers or Networks, this may be on a very large scale or only on a local network (LAN).

# task 2 - The Creeper Program

Malicious Software has been around since **1949**.
First know theories was created by **John von Neumann**
John devised the *von Neumann architecture* (which is very simply how computers transfer **data** to its hardware), produced work detailing **self-replicating** computer programs.

The Creeper Program, also known as the "Creeper worm" or "virus", was the first-ever virus to be created. Written by **Bob Thomas** in 1971, the program used **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) to transfer itself between computers (keep reading to learn about ARPANET).
Programmed in PDP-10 Assemby, which ran on OS TENEX
Displayed "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"
**Ray Tomlision** redesigned the Creeper Virus to copy to each computer.

## ARPANET

ARPANET originally started out with two specific protocols; Remote login and transferring files. After their project was denied, the team working on this project (known as the **Network Working Group**) decided to design a program formally called the *Network Control Program*, without all the unnecessary details, this was the start of computers being able to communicate within networks. 

**Packet Switching** is breaking data into packets to then route or send said data to the receiver. The receiver (computer that is receiving the data) will then reassemble the packets back into whatever data/file was being sent. (this is still used today!)

This was the main way that data was transferred using ARPANET.

# task 2 - questions and answers

1. Who re-designed the Creeper Virus?

Ray Tomlinson

2. How is data transferred through a network?

Packet Switching

3. Who created the first concept of a virus?

John Von Neumann

4. What text did the Creeper program print to the screen?

"I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"

5. What does ARPANET stand for>

Advanced Research Projects Agency Network

6. Which team created the network control program?

Network Working Group

7. What is the first virus commonly known as?

Creeper

# Task 3 - Reaper

Reaper's purpose was to remove any copies of creeper that it could find, but it moved differently to Creeper
Bob Thomas' main project was "to develop a resource-sharing capability", known as RSEXEC "so that users could develop applications that could move to and run on another computer".
Reaper would move its way similarly to Creeper and then get to work; removing Creeper.
Reaper was actually first **anti-virus**

## task 3 - questions and answers

1. Who created Reaper?

Ray Tomlinson

2. What type of malware may Reaper be known as?

nematode

3. What was the first anti-virus program known as?

Reaper

4. What was Bob Thomas's main project to develop?

a resource-sharing capability

5. What does API stand for?

Application PRogramming Interface

# task 4 - Wabbit

**The Wabbit**(Rabbit) virus was written in **1974**.
One of first *self-replicating* malware.
Wabbit would work so fast that the system would figuratively choke on its resources and end up crashing. 
Considered first malicious program and grew from concepts of malware created from *other computer scientists*
Malware only infected hosts machine.
Rabbit as being a form of DoS known as "fork bomb"

**Rabbit works by** creating an infinite loop that continually creates system processes and copies of the original file, creating a high number of CPU cycles (the time for the execution of one process) which "constipates" the system and consumes operating system resources, causing it to get slower until its eventual crash. 

# task 4 - questions and answers

1. What is a modern day fork bomb also known as?

denial of service attack

2. Was Rabbit one of the first malicious programs

3. What did the name "Wabbit" derive from?

looney tunes cartoons

# task 5 - ANIMAL

In **1975** first *trojan* was written
**ANIMAL**, created by **John Walker**, would act as a game and ask the user a number of questions to guess the type of animal they were thinking of. Whilst the user played the "fun" game, another program, or subroutine, called "PERVADE" would create a copy of itself and *ANIMAL* in every directory that the user has access to. 

*ANIMAL* was **NOT** malicious however, the program was carefully written to ensure that no directory structure or files were damaged. It spread across UNIVACs (Universal Automatic Computer) when users with overlapping permissions discovered the game. Eventually, the program was halted by an unintended Operating System upgrade, which changed the format of the file status tables that PERVADE used for safe copying (file status tables allowed the program to avoid copying to the wrong area, causing damage) this meant that ANIMAL could not find any place safe to copy and stopped itself.

# task 5 - questions and answers

1. When was PERVADE added to ANIMAL?

1975

2. Did John think this was a good idea?

Y

3. What computers did the program spread across?

UNIVACs

4. What type of malware is ANIMAL also known as?

a trojan

5. Who built the wooden horse?

the Greeks

# task 6 - Elk Cloner

**Richard Skrenta**, a *15 year old high school student*, created one of the first *microcomputer viruses* that spread outside of a computer system or laboratory.

Works by attaching itself to the *Apple II OS* and spread via floppy disk. It was written in 1982 originally as a practical joke to mess with his friends.

**Elk Cloner** used *boot sector virus*. The program was placed into a game's code until an unsuspecting victim started the game for the 50th time. This then activated the virus. Instead of launching the game, it would change to a blank screen that displayed a poem about the virus:

Elk Cloner: The program with a personality
it will get on all your disks
it will infiltrate your chips
Yes, it's Cloner!
It will stick to you like glue
It will modify RAM too
Send in the Cloner!

It had a *signature byte* to detect if the virus was already on the system.

**Boot Sector Viruses** less common in modern technology

# task 6 questions and answers

1. Which US Military regiment caught the virus?

US Navy

2. How many lines long is the Elk Cloner poem?

7

3. When was Elk Cloner written?

1982

4. Is a boot sector virus more or less common in modern technology?

less

5. How long did it take Richard to write the program?

2 weeks

6. Which Operating System was affected?

Apple II

# task 7 - Morris Internet Work

*Morris Internet Work*, relased in **1988 by Robert Tappan Morris** to highlight seurity falws of the academic networks that it travelled to.

Infected computers multiple times and caused DoS -> fork bomb.

Was first person to be arrested.

Used Unix Sendmail, rsh (remote shell)/rexec and week passwords

The worm infected 2000 computers within 15 hours and it often took 2 days to get off a single computer, rendering most useless. Reportedly 6000  computers were infected in the end and this was around 10% of the internet at the time.

**Berkeley r-commands** big way that allowed Morris to access the computers

# task 7 - questions and answers

Denial of Service

4. When was this worm released?

1988

5. How many computers did it infect within 15 hours?

2000

6. What does rsh mean?

remote shell

7. Under which act was Morris arrested for?

1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

# task 8 - Cascade

**Cascade** was notably the first type of malware to use a form of encryption. The encryption was used to keep the program undected.

In the 80s, specifically on the **Digital Equipment** (a large computer company) **operating systems**, a common file extension for executables was **".COM"**. Similarly to how a BATCH file or a .sh (shell script, used on Linux operating systems) file would work, this extension allowed text files containing commands to be executable.

Virus did not try to infect IBM Computers by looking for a text copyright, but bug made it overlook it. The virus only worked by executing the infected file.

## How would you know if you had been infected?

Check file size. Infectedf iles would have much larger file size.
Check the HOST file.
Between **Oct 1** and **Dec 31** the payload would activate.

# task 8 - questinos and answers
